            Hi, thank you for taking a moment to pop in and see what this is all about. I’m using this website as a means to develop myself, grow, and learn. In addition I want to provide you with the knowledge and tools to drive creation and growth in your daily life.
            <br>
            I am motivated and working to increase my knowledge, influence people positively, and continue to enjoy my life. 
            <br>
            I’m a tinkerer and always striving to make cool things and improve already existing areas of my life. If you would like to stay up to date with the collusion of creation (Which you should!) Feel encouraged to register your information on the contact me page!
            <br>
            My resume is available upon request, please feel free to reach out to me @ContactMe.
