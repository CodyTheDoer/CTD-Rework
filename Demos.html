                    I came up with the idea for the Pleasant Clock one day when I was looking at the numbers on a digital display enjoying the way that they occasionally mirror each other in interesting ways. I thought why not create a clock that does just that. I researched scientifically calming colors and utilized them in the implimentation of my design. This clock will look broken at first but that's the point, it doesn't change every second, it helps us remember to slow down and enjoy the view.

                    This is my example of a classic coding exercise, I created a javascript based calculator and utilized CSS and HTML to make it visually retro. I had a ton of fun creating this, I really enjoy artistic work and this project let me stretch my legs.

                    This Javascript based sketchpad is a deep dive into DOM Manipulation, first enter the number of squares per side you want to use to generate your Sketchpad, then hit build grid and start sketching, the tiles will generate a new random color when you interact with them, have fun and send me your sketches!
